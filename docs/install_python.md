# Installing Python

## For Windows Users

### **Recommended For Windows users:** Install Python from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/search?hl=en-us&gl=us&publisher=Python%20Software%20Foundation).

With the above method nothing else is required

## For Non Windows Users or as an Alternative

Alternatively you can install from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

When downloading directly from Pythons website be sure to add it to PATH, and click "Add Python to environment variables" Under Customize Install -> Advanced Options (See below)
